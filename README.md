## ✨ Overview  

The **Multiple Disease Prediction System App** 🧬 is an intelligent web application built using **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** in **Python**.  
This app can **predict the likelihood of multiple diseases** — including **Diabetes 🩸**, **Heart Disease ❤️**, and **Parkinson’s Disease 🧠** — based on user-inputted medical parameters.  

Developed in **PyCharm** and deployed using **Streamlit**, the project combines **data science, healthcare, and AI** to provide fast, accurate, and user-friendly predictions.  

💡 **Highlight:**  
A one-stop predictive health assistant that helps users identify early warning signs for major diseases using smart algorithms and interactive web visualization. 🚀

## 📊 Dataset Information  

All datasets are obtained from **Kaggle**:  
- **Diabetes Dataset:** [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- **Heart Disease Dataset:** [Kaggle - Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)  
- **Parkinson’s Dataset:** [Kaggle - Parkinson’s Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debasisdotcom/parkinsons-disease-dataset)  

Each dataset includes multiple medical parameters (like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.) used for model training and evaluation.
